Working procedure
1. Download any free web server software example xampp.
2. Download the files and place the "IQA" directory in the htdocs folder of xampp.
3. Open XAMPP and click on "Apache" and "MySQL". This creates a local web server for your computer files.
4. Go to any browser and type in "http://localhost/IQA", and the magic should happen(make sure the XAMPP application is running in the background.)
